### Documentation In your README.md file, describe the exported values of each module defined in your `lib` directory. Every function description should include it's airty (expected number of parameters), the expected data for each parameter (data-type and limitations), and the expected output behavior (for both valid and invalid use). Feel free to include any additional information that you would like.

greet.js
the values that are being exported from the greet.js module are the greet function. The expected behavior for valid use is to return 'hello ${name}. The expected behavior for invalid use is to return null.


arithmetic.js
the values that are being exported from the arithmetic.js module are an object that contains 2 functions and the data-type has to be a number. The expected behavior for valid use is to return the answer of a +b. The expected behavior for invalid use is to return null when its not a number and the answer has to be a number. Same thing for sub just the value of a and b are being subtracted.
